/* Problem: What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop().length;

Answer: The return value would be the length of the string, 'caterpillar', which is 11.
The pop method removes the last element of the array and returns it. The length
property is then called on 'caterpillar'.
